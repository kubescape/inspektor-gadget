 *     the child is admitted under the current generation: 2;

 * re-admit the cgroup. The target used to re-admit, so a revision committed
 * between the two task_alloc programs left the child unconstructed
 * (CONSTRUCT). A parked claim keeps the route's early claim on its record
 * (ACTIVE, or RETIRING once a revision commits past it: G019 gap 3), which
 * blocks only the withdrawal and the reuse of that record until the target
 * takes and releases it: the child is built under exactly the generation
 * its source admitted. One park
 * per forking task (the target runs in the same task_alloc call); only that
 * task touches it, and its task_free releases a park no target took.
