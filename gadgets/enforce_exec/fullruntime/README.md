# Experimental persistent exec owner

## Legacy ABI2 reference and shared Go boundary

**The legacy per-binding ABI2 lifecycle below is not the shared-node activation
contract.** [Commit `dabee7d08`](https://github.com/kubescape/inspektor-gadget/commit/dabee7d08345752cada90c326e25cd7b6855d62d)
publishes ordinary-Go shared preparation, ownership/accounting, receipt cleanup
and bounded clean retry. Those paths and their selected Go tests do not establish
kernel reclamation, accepted-generation publication/reload or native withdrawal
integration for the shared replacement.

The published [`StartNode`](https://github.com/kubescape/inspektor-gadget/blob/dabee7d08345752cada90c326e25cd7b6855d62d/gadgets/enforce_exec/fullruntime/shared_node.go#L67-L72)
refuses startup; binding inspection cannot report protection.
[Full-image admission and `Ready`](https://github.com/kubescape/inspektor-gadget/blob/dabee7d08345752cada90c326e25cd7b6855d62d/gadgets/enforce_exec/fullruntime/shared_host.go#L64-L74)
also refuse shared activation (`Ready` is defined at
[lines 191–199](https://github.com/kubescape/inspektor-gadget/blob/dabee7d08345752cada90c326e25cd7b6855d62d/gadgets/enforce_exec/fullruntime/shared_host.go#L191-L199)).
The [legacy publisher](https://github.com/kubescape/inspektor-gadget/blob/dabee7d08345752cada90c326e25cd7b6855d62d/gadgets/enforce_exec/fullruntime/publication.go#L70-L74)
rejects development ABI3 activation rather than treating ABI2 publication as a
shared receipt. This boundary defines no new wire ABI. Shared native integration,
physical Ready and kernel qualification remain unavailable or unproved; the
legacy isolated matrix and lifetime-credit rules below do not qualify them.

This package contains the **legacy per-binding `Owner` profile** and the unfinished
shared-node `NodeEnforcer` replacement. The legacy profile provides the native
persistent owner, bounded whole-exec gate, publication coordinator and isolated
tests for frozen policy-map revisions. Its embedding supplies authenticated
runtime leases and public event provenance; readiness requires the explicitly
supported kernel/runtime environment. Its proofs do not qualify the shared-node
replacement.

## Shared-node implementation status and API contracts

`NodeEnforcer.Ready` **never reports Ready**: it returns a startup error when the
host is absent, mismatched, incomplete or closing/closed, and otherwise returns
`ErrSharedNativeUnavailable`. Routing, union evaluator adaptation, qualified
history publication and required attachment receipts are not integrated.
Protocol preparation and Go tests do not establish protected workloads.
`se_publication_arm` is the only shared commit/withdrawal producer, and only from
an authenticated `cgroup_kn_lock_live` barrier. A syscall receipt is not that
producer. `se_arm_frame` is per-CPU scratch, not epoch authority. Shared exec
reads `se_epoch_bank` through the kernel-owned `se_epoch_index`. `SE_ARM_BIND`
reserves that index on an earlier barrier; commit only accepts an index that
already names the cell. The unread `se_accepted_epochs` hash is not that
catalogue. An isolated Clang 19 load of the arm, including index bind and bank lookup,
was accepted by local kernel `7.1.13+parrot7-amd64`. That is not the admitted
BTF/Clang 21.1.8 matrix, not Ready, reload integration, or kernel qualification.

- Private shared-object preparation uploads compiler-owned content only. It
  grants no root, snapshot or image qualification.
- `fullpolicy.CompileSharedPolicyCompact` and
  `fullpolicy.NewSharedSnapshotCompact` provide scalar/compact diagnostics, not
  memory admission or activation guarantees. The Limited compiler and private
  worker have conditional logical accounting, but complete producing-artifact
  qualification remains unavailable; see the scope below.
- The private operation context deliberately has `context.Cause(op) == op.Err()`;
  it does not propagate a custom parent cause. Providers must not retain it beyond
  the synchronous, joined operation. Joining retires logical ownership, not
  allocator/GC or scheduler resources.

### Conditional shared-worker qualification

The private worker covers only a **never-staged, generation-zero binding**. It
uses one joined operation for object compilation, union compilation and staging;
it does not establish accepted history, general reload or activation.

On the exact reviewed Go 1.27.3 Linux/amd64 source/tool/profile pins, the
[conditional composition](../fullpolicy/qualification/worker_composition.go)
derives these logical operation-owned terms:

| Term | Bytes |
|---|---:|
| Bootstrap `B` | 536 |
| Project phase maximum | 1,310,800 |
| Selected dependency maximum | 1,454 |
| Combined tail `T` | 1,312,254 |

The fixed reservation would be `B + T = 1,312,790`; object and union compiler
debits remain cumulative and separate. Package/library startup owners, including
the carrier and warmed type caches, are not charged again per operation. These
terms are not an allocator, stack, RSS or complete node-resource bound.

**Complete worker evidence remains unavailable.** `deriveWorkerTail` still
refuses, so the conditional calculation cannot issue a positive PREBUILD or
carrier. Both producer phases generate fresh lowering and typed-Go sentinel
checks bound to the selected snapshot, exports, profile/tools and runner
identity. The typed check does not certify arbitrary unsafe or assembly writes;
opaque-input disposition and final published-consumer/release provenance remain
separate requirements. Diagnostic checks against older published consumer pins
do not qualify the unpublished shared-runtime changes.

The [qualification tooling](../fullpolicy/qualification/README.md) keeps runner
source linkage `UNPROVEN` and native activation `NOT_QUALIFIED`. Approved
signed-image digest verification remains the external release/deployment trust
requirement; these tools do not establish it, and hashes alone are not
authentication. No positive descriptor or Ready state follows from these local
tools or their tests.

The remaining sections describe the **legacy per-binding `Owner` profile**,
including its lifecycle and historical isolated proofs, not `NodeEnforcer`.

## Legacy per-binding Owner support and security limits

This is the **legacy full persistent-owner profile**, not the
[simple path-only engine](../README.md). It currently admits only the two exact
custom **amd64** kernel artifacts in [KERNEL-MATRIX.md](KERNEL-MATRIX.md). Stock
distribution kernels and arm64 are not supported by this profile. BPF LSM and
ftrace availability alone do not satisfy its admission checks.

### Best-effort operational audit

**Audit is best effort across operational faults and reloads.** Audit policy
evaluation must not intentionally deny audited decisions or evaluator
unknown/error results, must not grant uncertain roles, and must preserve earlier
LSM denials. This does not promise uninterrupted execution: tracking, resource or
structural faults and closed admission during reload or re-attestation may block
even audit-only workloads. Enforcement-capable policies remain fail-closed; do
not fall open to hide an operational fault.

On a precommit candidate refusal, retain the last-good active policy and accepted
history. The embedding must report failure/NotReady rather than advertise the
rejected revision as active. Reopen admission only after safe rollback and phase
cleanup; failed rollback retains pending ownership and the closed gate until
recovery. Do not discard trusted state to force admission. A postcommit error
requires resuming the same committed generation, not rolling back to the old
policy.

The legacy mocked Go regression `TestLegacyOwnerUpdateBestEffortAdmission`
covers precommit refusal, drain cancellation and rollback failure/recovery
through `Owner.Update` with fake maps/control and a heap admission word. This is
protocol coverage, not native bootstrap, ABI3/shared activation, physical Ready,
Kubernetes status propagation or kernel qualification.

### Scope, runtime helpers and operator consent

An owner covers one **exact cgroup**, not its descendants. Creating or moving
into a child cgroup does not extend policy coverage. A trusted embedding must
exclude unsupported cgroup delegation and authenticate its runtime lease; the
node-agent strict admission contract includes cgroup-mount, capability,
namespace and seccomp restrictions. Movement observation detects changes and
invalidates readiness; it is not a general mechanism that prevents migration.

This profile has no `BindRestricted` host-namespace exception and no inferred
runtime-helper exemption. A `kubectl exec`/`docker exec` helper entering from an
unobserved creator can fail lineage checks and leave the owner NotReady. A
closed gate can also reject exec or fork during lifecycle operations. Allowing a
`/runc` path does not establish creator lineage or authenticate that binary.
Treat helper disruption as an explicit cost of opting into strict enforcement,
not as a reason to infer an exemption or reset trusted state.

Enforcement consent belongs to the host operator: global
`operator.oci.allow-enforcement` defaults to false. Image behavior metadata
declares what an image requests; it cannot enable that host setting. Image
verification, runtime admission and policy validation remain separate checks.

### Role-entry authoring and isolation

The current compiler requires a `setRole` rule to be an allow, but does **not**
require an actor constraint. An omitted actor (or an empty actor object) places
no restriction on who may enter the role: any matching successful exec can
propose that transition. For example, a rule targeting `bwrap` and assigning
`sandbox-helper` without an actor restriction can let the agent launch `bwrap`
itself to obtain that role. The executable's name is not an authorization proof.

Review each role-entry rule as a grant of future authority. Constrain the actual
authorized actor using meaningful role/path/image predicates where appropriate,
and check that untrusted code cannot first enter or control that actor. An empty
actor object is not a mitigation. This is authoring guidance, not a claim that
the current validator rejects broad grants. Role changes are policy-local and
commit only after successful exec; role labels received through telemetry do
not grant authority.

A constrained grant in the native `fullpolicy` Go IR can look like this (not CLI
YAML or a complete deployment policy):

```go
fromImage := true
policy := fullpolicy.Policy{
    ID: "sandbox-policy", Revision: "1", Mode: fullpolicy.Enforce,
    RootRole: "agent", Default: fullpolicy.Deny,
    Rules: []fullpolicy.Rule{{
        Name: "enter-sandbox-helper", Action: fullpolicy.Allow,
        Actor: fullpolicy.Actor{
            Role: []string{"trusted-launcher"},
            Path: []string{"/usr/libexec/sandbox-launcher"},
            FromImage: &fromImage,
        },
        Target: fullpolicy.Target{
            Path: []string{"/usr/bin/bwrap"}, FromImage: &fromImage,
            SetRole: "sandbox-helper",
        },
    }},
}
```

All three actor constraints must match. This assumes the launcher already has
authenticated `trusted-launcher` role history in this policy and cannot be
controlled or invoked as a confused deputy by untrusted code. The example does
not grant that initial role: its default root role stays `agent`, and missing
history is not authority. The image-origin predicate describes admitted backing
files; it does not prove that the process or its inputs are trustworthy. Review
how the launcher role is established and what it permits before using the grant.
A wildcard-only actor such as `Path: []string{"/**"}` still admits arbitrary
actor paths; its mere presence is not meaningful authorization.

The compiler currently accepts broad grants without an actor-warning API.
`TestRoleEntryAuthoring` and the ordinary Go/C parity cases document this behavior,
including deny/conflict suppression. They are not proof of kernel fact acquisition
or of the runtime's successful-exec role commit.

Roles are **not hostile-code isolation boundaries**. Processes can delegate work
through shared files, IPC, signals or services; containers in a pod commonly
share networking and may share storage. The combined authority reachable through
those channels is a threat-model upper bound, not a literal union performed by
the rule evaluator. Separate pods are a starting point for stronger separation,
but also require appropriate network, storage and service-access controls.

### Restart and recovery

Policy reload retains the same live owner's hooks and history; restarting the
gadget or its owning process does not. Maps and links are not pinned for crash
persistence. Once those resources close, enforcement and retained role history
are lost; a fresh owner cannot reconstruct them from event labels or current
cgroup membership.

Fresh bootstrap authorizes the exact trusted init threadgroup and descendants
whose creator lineage the owner actually observed. Arbitrary already-running
multiprocess containers are not generally re-adoptable; unknown pre-existing
tasks refuse readiness rather than receive inferred root roles. See the
[conservative lineage contract](OWNER-ABI.md#conservative-lineage-boundary).
Withdrawing a faulted owner removes protection; it is not recovery of protected
state. Pinning alone would not supply the missing recovery protocol.

## Word and ownership

One aligned 64-bit word in a writable `BPF_F_MMAPABLE` ARRAY holds a closed high
bit and a low-bit admission count (maximum 4,096). The map has 65,536 lifetime
slots. `GateMap` allocates monotonically; retired slots stay closed and are never
reused. At most 1,024 allocated, nonretired slots may coexist. Exhaustion is an
explicit refusal, not recycling: this avoids a stale pre-admission reader
admitting against a different binding after slot ABA.

Use one Go allocator/publisher owner per map. No ordinary store or
`bpf_map_update_elem` may replace an activated word. Both BPF and Go use aligned
64-bit atomic operations. The first actual BPF exec transaction calls `fg_enter`,
then latches its original binding, slot and transaction identity before looking
up policy. A successful admission owns exactly one release. Do not copy admission
or pending-transition ownership to forked/cloned children.

`BeginUpdate(ctx)` atomically closes admission while retaining the count, waits
for zero and returns an exclusive publication lease. Publish a fully prepared,
frozen inner map before `Reopen`; on precommit preparation/publication failure,
retain the old map and reopen only after safe candidate cleanup. A timeout reopens
only the closure this owner acquired, preserving outstanding admissions. A stale
lease cannot reopen a later
publisher's closure. `Retire` permanently closes a drained slot. `GateMap.Close`
refuses unmapping until all slots have been retired.

Admission and the generic `Leave` helper use bounded CAS loops (64 attempts).
Contention is explicit: failed admission grants nothing; failed generic release
retains ownership/count and must be retried or reported stuck. The role-lifecycle
fixture instead uses `fg_leave_owned`: it claims and clears transaction ownership
under the task lock, finishes all owned writes, then performs one final atomic
subtraction. Duplicate cleanup without a claim never subtracts. Underflow is a
sticky corruption fault, never a reset or compensating write.

## Whole-exec integration boundary

The caller must commit roles and clear pending transaction state **before** its
final count decrement. It must match completion to the original `bprm` and slot,
not the current PID/cgroup (nonleader exec and migration can change these).

Syscall-exit cleanup alone is insufficient: failed `kernel_execve` can return to
a kernel caller without a syscall-exit event. The proposed full runtime requires
verified `fexit/bprm_execve` completion plus task-exit fallback, attached before
admitting LSM transactions. Successful `sched_process_exec` can commit roles, but
release must follow all transaction-owned writes. A separate isolated role fixture has passed all five required hook attachments
and 14 lifecycle cases on the pinned custom kernel, including scripts, failures,
nonleader exec, fork/vfork and an explicitly injected missing-fexit task-exit
fallback. This does not prove persistent production-owner publication, bootstrap
lineage, cgroup migration during active admission, ptrace drain behavior, or
production shutdown ordering. This package does not supply that owner.

Closed-gate exec attempts need an explicit, observable operational failure policy;
never bypass authored enforcement while publication is underway. This can disrupt
runtime helpers and even explicitly audited workloads during a reload. The gate
library does not silently choose this product behavior or claim that it is wired.

The opaque verdict candidate fails closed when a bounded TASK or WORK quota
(`SE_PROFILE_TASK_QUOTA`, `SE_PROFILE_SCRATCH_QUOTA`), the deferred storage, or
the source/target handoff is exhausted: Strict refuses the birth or exec and
Audit leaves the child unevaluated. Building with
`ENFORCE_EXEC_POOL_OPAQUE_FAIL_CLOSED_RATE_CANDIDATE` adds the
`opaque_real_fail_closed_rates` counters (quota LIMIT, source refusal, missing
target, evaluation WORK refusal, storage quarantine, other constructor
failure, and since G019 M0: first-exec qualification fault, pending-receipt
quarantine, birth-target parent open failure, and a reserved gap-refusal
class), and `FailClosedRate` maps two snapshots to a degraded verdict for a
threshold. Its eleventh counter reports WORK start retry-bound exhaustions
(`SE_PROFILE_WORK_RETRIES`, default min(16, WORK quota)),
a subset of those refusals. A live product node polls these counters
(`shared_fail_closed_health.go`, see the fail-closed runtime section below);
`Ready` still stays unavailable.

The G019 M0 classes count the outcomes G025 excluded:

- qualification fault: an owned exec refused because `real_owner_birth_qualify`
  faulted at `bprm_check_security` (the same fault at `task_alloc` is a source
  refusal);
- pending-receipt quarantine: an owned exec refused while a prior terminal
  receipt is pending (`real_owner_reader_begin_core` result `& 8`,
  `real_owner_reader_quarantine_pending`);
- `real_owner_child_open_parent` failure in `real_owner_child_finish`;
- gap refusal: interpreter continuation refusals only (see Class [9]
  below). Since G019 gap 4 (review H1) a #! script or binfmt_misc interpreter pass of an
  owned exec is continued (`ENFORCE_EXEC_POOL_OPAQUE_INTERP_CONTINUATION_CANDIDATE`,
  every product object): it is evaluated for its own file under the exec's
  frozen original class, and its role proposal accumulates into the same
  exec transaction that the terminal commits once. A refused continuation
  (receipt or failure frames, reader classification or recovery, the
  suspended terminal WORK, exec_binprm depth beyond 5, the WORK rebind, or
  a missing continuation/prepare graph entry) counts here, with its reason
  in `opaque_real_interp_stats`; Strict denies, Audit allows and
  quarantines. A later pass that carries a terminal fault (first-exec
  qualification or terminal drain) is refused before any continuation
  with the same verdict and cleanup, counted once as QUALIFY `[6]` or
  PENDING `[7]` like a first pass, never also here. Before gap 4 that exec was refused as a pending receipt
  (`[7]`); a real pending receipt still is. Residual by construction: an
  `AT_EXECVE_CHECK` (6.18) runs no `bprm_check` and is never evaluated; a
  binfmt_misc `F` (fix-binary) interpreter, opened at registration and
  possibly outside the container's mount namespace, is evaluated like any
  file, and a path that does not resolve for the policy denies under Strict.
  Every pass is evaluated, but the candidate evaluator has no per-file
  (path or image) facts yet: its target image is always unknown and a pass
  differs from the previous one only through the roles proposed so far and
  the credentials. A policy of "allowed script, denied interpreter" is
  therefore not expressible yet; it becomes so when target facts are
  collected per pass, with no change to the continuation itself.

The live verdict test checks each class against an exact test-only witness
(`opaque_real_exec_exclusions` for the G019 M0 classes). Remaining exclusion:
an exec of a task that carries no TASK (born before the binding, or a birth
already counted as refused or unconstructed) fails the exec reader's parent
open and is not counted a second time. A zero rate is therefore evidence for
managed, TASK-carrying births and execs only.

First-exec qualification (`real_owner_birth_qualify`, the birth receipts and
their issue, stamp, observe and retire path) is built with
`ENFORCE_EXEC_POOL_OPAQUE_REAL_POLICY_VERDICT_CANDIDATE`;
`ENFORCE_EXEC_POOL_OPAQUE_SUCCESSFUL_BIRTH_DIAGNOSTIC` only adds test-only
witness counters and the `task_kill` signal-0 diagnostic.

The final-free physical-reuse fix (`se_of_withdraw_directory` in
`lsm/task_free`) is part of every build of the candidate's final-free program,
not of the rate witness: the object refuses to compile without it.

User-approved G025 capacity thresholds:

- **128/16 is the qualified default profile for the opaque candidate build**
  (TASK/WORK quota per binding, two bindings; WORK start retries
  min(16, WORK quota)). 64/8 and 256/32 are qualified alternatives; 256/32 has
  no stack headroom. The candidate source has no default: the build passes
  every value as `-D` flags, all with `-DSE_PROFILE_BINDINGS=2`:
  - 64/8: `-DSE_PROFILE_TASKS=128 -DSE_PROFILE_TASK_QUOTA=64
    -DSE_PROFILE_SCRATCH=16 -DSE_PROFILE_SCRATCH_QUOTA=8
    -DSE_PROFILE_WORK_RETRIES=8`
  - 128/16 (default): `-DSE_PROFILE_TASKS=256 -DSE_PROFILE_TASK_QUOTA=128
    -DSE_PROFILE_SCRATCH=32 -DSE_PROFILE_SCRATCH_QUOTA=16`
    (`SE_PROFILE_WORK_RETRIES` defaults to 16)
  - 256/32: `-DSE_PROFILE_TASKS=512 -DSE_PROFILE_TASK_QUOTA=256
    -DSE_PROFILE_SCRATCH=64 -DSE_PROFILE_SCRATCH_QUOTA=32
    -DSE_PROFILE_WORK_RETRIES=16`

  The in-repo product shared build profile is separate: the product object
  (`g19pkg128`, `candidate/gadget.yaml`) is **128/32** (G019 burst gate,
  user decision: 8 burst streams zero-gated). `(W − 1) / 2 ≥ 8` needs
  `W ≥ 17` and the verdict source requires a power-of-two WORK quota, so 32
  (capacity 15) is the smallest; it costs 32 more WORK slots per node
  (`se_opaque_work_payload` 19,456 B each: about +614 KiB of map values),
  no stack and at most +15 static instructions per root.
- **Steady-state gate** (test reaper at 2 ms): 0 Strict fail-closed refusals
  and 0 Audit unevaluated children at a sustained 400 births/s per node,
  3 streams, at least 10,000 paced births per exact kernel and class, at
  128/16. 800/s and 1600/s are exploratory ceiling points only.
- **Burst gate** (G019/G020, product reaper; user decision "gate at
  capacity"). The burst capacity of a binding is
  `ConcurrentBirthCapacity(W, syncReturn)` concurrent births for a
  per-binding WORK quota `W` (`fail_closed_rate.go`); the test computes it
  from the object's WORK quota and the presence of `opaque_real_work_sync`.
  An in-flight child holds at most its birth WORK and its exec evaluation
  WORK at once and the binding's managed parent retains one WORK, so the
  static bound is `(W − 1) / 2`.
  - **With the synchronous WORK return** (option C, below): `(W − 1) / 2`,
    3 at 64/8, 7 at 128/16, **15 at the product's 128/32**, 15 at 256/32
    (8 streams are zero-gated on the product; user decision: gate the
    conservative static bound). A WORK credit is held only from its charge
    until its settling program returns, never waiting for the userspace
    reaper. A child then holds at most one WORK at a time, so the bound per
    forking parent thread is about `W − retained − 1`; it is measured as
    information only (`work_peak`), never gated.
  - **Without it** (`(W − 3) / 2`, option A): 2 at 64/8, 6 at 128/16, 14 at
    256/32. The WORK credits of an exited child come back asynchronously
    through the product reaper and nothing throttles forks meanwhile; the
    capacity reserves one late child. Refusals at 6 streams still happened
    under reaper stalls (G019 chain7: 1 of 48; chain15 fs6x20: 4 of 160 on
    both kernels at 1-3 ms reap latency), so it is advisory and test only
    (lead decision (b)): the product object requires the synchronous return
    (`#error` + NEG `pkg-without-sync-return`, and product admission refuses
    an image without `opaque_real_work_sync`), and non-sync bursts are
    measured, never zero-gated (the burst gate counts every refusal). Sizing rule (option B):
    `W ≥ 1 + 2 · (concurrent births + λ · D)`, with `λ` the binding's
    birth rate and `D` the reap-latency tail (`λ · D`: births whose credits
    are still in the reaper).
  - At or below capacity: 0 refusals for 1,000 back-to-back births (witness
    `fail_closed=0`, evaluated == births, no reaper `Faulted`), Strict and
    Audit, on both kernels. With the synchronous return at 3, 6 and 7
    streams, plus: every settled WORK `returned` or `claim-lost`, no
    synchronous slow path (pending, fault, stuck), settled birth WORKs ==
    constructed births and settled evaluation WORKs == completed execs, and
    a WORK peak ≤ retained + 1 + streams + threads. Evidence: 10 runs per
    kernel per class at capacity (40 runs, `ONLY=s7x10 run-g19dec2.sh`;
    `ONLY=s6x10` for objects without the synchronous return).
  - Above capacity (8 streams; 32 streams designed to overflow, with
    `IG_OPAQUE_REAL_VERDICT_EXPECT_REFUSALS=1`, which requires at least one
    refusal): a measured over-capacity run, not a zero gate. It passes only
    if every unevaluated birth (user-space births minus the evaluator's own
    count) is exactly one counted witness class, Strict user-space refusals
    equal the witness total, every class equals its test-only witness (a
    self-consistency check: those witnesses sit at the same BPF sites),
    `Degraded` is set whenever a refusal was counted, no reaper fault, and
    the accounts drain back to the baseline afterwards.
  - Attribution: every burst line prints the round period, the slowest reap
    (`reap_max`), the exact WORK high-water of the binding (`work_peak`, on
    objects built with the test-only
    `ENFORCE_EXEC_POOL_OPAQUE_WORK_HIGH_WATER_DIAGNOSTIC`; never in a
    product object) and the synchronous return's outcomes (`sync=`) next to
    the reaper's `claim-held` count.
- **Synchronous WORK return at settle** (G019 option C,
  `ENFORCE_EXEC_POOL_OPAQUE_WORK_SYNC_RETURN_CANDIDATE`, requires the reap
  events and credit at exit; in the product object). The program that moves
  a WORK to DONE returns it at its own top level
  (`real_owner_work_sync_return`): the `task_alloc` target for the birth WORK
  (owned by the parent, DONE at construction), the `sched_process_exec` and
  `bprm_execve` fexit terminals for the evaluation WORK, and the exit program
  and the `task_free` fallback for a WORK still suspended at death. Returning
  only at exit would hold the birth and evaluation WORKs for the child's
  whole life.
  - The settling call returns its result in the low and the WORK slot + 1 in
    the high 32 bits of R0 (no stack in the 512-byte chains); the
    synchronous return reads the cookie from the charge and visits only a
    meta still DONE/ABORTED under that cookie. It runs the reaper's own
    seven stages unchanged (`bpf_loop`, or `SE_OWK_SYNC_STRAIGHT_LINE` if the
    load spike `run-g19sync-spike.sh` refuses spin locks in its callback):
    every stage before the account return is required, because the account
    bit is the WORK slot and a charge meeting a non-FREE meta faults the
    account.
  - Zero once: with the flag the charge-time payload zero is skipped; the
    return-time zero (stage 3, which every path to `META_FREE` passes) is
    the only one, and the header-is-zero check at charge verifies it.
  - Visit claim (`se_owk_visit_claims`): the synchronous return claims a WORK
    for its whole sequence, tried once; the reap command claims per step and
    answers `SE_OWK_CLAIM_HELD` (6) while it is held, which the reaper treats
    as final for that cookie (as STALE and ALREADY_RETURNED). Every
    synchronous exit other than returned or claim-lost emits a recovery
    `WORK_DONE`, and the reaper resumes a WORK from `CLEANING`,
    `REFUND_PENDING` or `META_FREE` with its cookie (also after a restart). A
    claim still held a second later counts `stuck` once. TASK keeps the
    single-reaper rule.
  - Witness `opaque_real_work_sync` (`work_sync.go`): settled per site, and
    returned / claim-lost / stale (benign) / pending / fault / stuck
    (Degraded: that WORK waits for the reaper).
  - Stack: the deepest chain of every root is unchanged (the `task_alloc`
    target stays 512 at 256/32); the synchronous path is root frame +
    `real_owner_work_sync_return` + its callback (`build-g19pkg.sh`
    SYNCSTACK, ≤ 512 at 64/8, 128/16 and 256/32).
  - Cost (chain11, `run-g19sync-latency.sh`: kernel `bpf_stats` sampled every
    50 ms by `build-g19sync/prog-stats` during the 7-stream, 1000-birth Strict
    burst; mean ns per run, synchronous return on vs off, the high-water
    objects `g19dec2sync128` vs `g19dec2hw128`):

    | Settle program | 6.12 / 6.18, on | 6.12 / 6.18, off |
    |---|---|---|
    | `child_exit_candidate` (death) | ≈ 3.8k | 3.7k–3.8k |
    | `child_final_free_candidate` (`task_free`) | 0.7k–1.0k | 0.6k–0.8k |
    | `failure_fexit_probe` (failed exec) | 0.35k–0.39k | 0.34k–0.37k |
    | `reader_success_probe` (exec success) | 47k–51k | 56k–58k |

    No measurable cost. Two caveats:
    - The `task_alloc` target is a tail call of the source; the kernel
      charges its time to the source and never samples it separately, so the
      birth settle is measured as `child_source_candidate` (sampled from the
      next run on; chain11 reported "4 of 5").
    - `reader_success_probe` is dominated by the test-only terminal-race
      rendezvous (`real_owner_terminal_auth_enter`: up to 4096
      `bpf_ktime_get_ns` spins, about 50 µs, on every exec completion), which
      the product object does not have (`build-g19pkg.sh` SPIN). The
      latency runs therefore also measure `g19dec2{sync,hw}ns128`, the same
      objects built with `SE_TERMINAL_RACE_NO_SPIN`.
- **Reuse-aware WORK reserve and reap** (every object, unconditional since
  chain15). A WORK slot can be returned by the reaper and by the synchronous
  return, and reused before a late returner or reserver runs. Reserve treats a
  FREE charge whose `last_returned` is not older than the new cookie as
  `SE_OL_CONTENDED` (retry another slot) instead of faulting the account;
  reap treats an already-FREE charge that was recharged or returned under
  another cookie as `SE_OWK_STALE`; only an exact unexpected shape still
  faults the account (fail-closed).
  - Root cause of the chain15 `burst-nosync-s6` account fault (dec2, a
    non-synchronous object; the product objects already had the reuse-aware
    branches): the reserve cookie-order race in `se_owk_begin`, established
    by elimination plus the post-fix fault-site witness run
    (`run-g19dec2.sh` `ONLY=fs6x20`: `burst-nosync-s6` ×20 on both kernels,
    0 faults and a zero witness expected; any site that fires is a second
    bug).
  - The IDENT baselines were refreshed once for this change, with evidence
    that every changed object equals the old source built with
    `-DSE_OWK_REUSE_AWARE=1` (all non-debug sections and the canonical BTF
    graph).
  - Fault-site witness (`ENFORCE_EXEC_POOL_OPAQUE_WORK_FAULT_SITE_DIAGNOSTIC`,
    test only; `#error` with `SE_PRODUCT_NO_TEST_RUN`): each of the nine
    account-fault sites ORs its own bit (1..9) into the account's fault word,
    so the attached test's `faulted (fault word …)` names the site. It adds
    no map; `g19dec2fs128` omits the WORK high-water witness to stay within
    the 512-byte stack.
- **Exec capsule store in task local storage** (G019 M4, user decision
  (ii); every object with the source capsule). The capsule that freezes an
  exec's original class (`full/shared_exec_capsule.h`) and its entry marker
  live in `BPF_MAP_TYPE_TASK_STORAGE` on the executing task
  (`se_exec_capsules` 104 B, `se_exec_markers` 16 B, `BPF_F_NO_PREALLOC`),
  no longer in ARRAYs that a loader had to size to `pid_max` (the operator
  never did: every product lookup missed, so Strict denied every exec and
  Audit allowed every exec unevaluated, both uncounted).
  - Storage is created only for an exec that can matter: its cgroup has a
    route-index entry or its task holds a TASK key (at entry and begin), or
    at the exec's first selected admission. Lookups never create; an exec
    that never matters has no storage and costs one failed lookup.
  - A failed create where storage is needed is a capsule fault: the
    admission degrades through the current route and the reader counts it
    as ADMISSION (Strict denies, Audit allows, both counted).
  - Per-task proof: entry, begin, every admission and the terminal of one
    exec run in the executing task, so another thread of the TGID can never
    touch its capsule; a non-FREE capsule at the task's next begin is a
    missed terminal and is retired.
  - Death retire: `real_owner_capsule_free` (its own `lsm/task_free`
    program, lookup only, 32-byte stack; the product task_free chain is
    untouched) retires a capsule still OPEN or FROZEN when its task dies,
    releasing the original-route pin before the kernel frees the storage.
    Counted in `se_exec_capsule_stats` [14] (DEATH_RETIRED, 15 cells).
    Attach it before the capsule terminal and detach it after.
    `CapsuleHealth` reports a death retire as Degraded (also in `Ready` and
    `Inspect`) for 60 s after it is observed (the fail-closed witness's
    Degraded window, `FailClosedRateDegradedWindow`), then it clears. It is
    never benign in steady state: the attach order leaves no window where a
    capsule exists without its terminal, the final reading is taken before
    detach, and every exec returns through `bprm_execve`'s fexit, so a
    retire means the terminal program did not run (a trampoline recursion
    miss). It is not sticky: the retire released the pin (a failed release
    is a sticky release fault) and the exec's admission was evaluated.
  - Uncovered exec (security review M2): when begin-time coverage is lost
    (the exec did not matter at begin, or the tracing helper's trylock made
    the create miss), the first selected admission freezes uncovered and
    records the original route's identity; a `#!`/binfmt_misc re-check (or
    a migrated admission) re-claims exactly that route and payload
    (`se_route_claim_ident_locked`) instead of faulting. A republish in
    between faults (counted). Test-only object `g19dec2unc128`
    (`ENFORCE_EXEC_POOL_OPAQUE_CAPSULE_UNCOVERED_DIAGNOSTIC`, NEG'd in
    product) and `run-g19dec2.sh ONLY=recheck`.
  - Ownership: a capsule is the current exec's only if that exec opened it
    (consumed its entry marker); a pending marker for the same task/bprm
    marks a matching capsule as an earlier exec's (stale, retired). In
    product objects (`SE_CAP_ENTRY_MARKS_LIVE_CAPSULE`) an exec entry marks
    itself whenever the task's capsule is not FREE, even if the exec does not
    matter yet: after a missed terminal and a missed begin, an exec at a
    reused bprm address that migrates into a selected cgroup retires the
    earlier exec's capsule as stale instead of re-claiming its route by
    identity (review OQ; `stale-ident-reused-bprm`).
  - Host contracts: `testdata/opaque_exec_capsule_contract.c` (the ARRAY
    adapter) and `testdata/opaque_exec_capsule_task_storage_contract.c`
    (storage gating, failed create, migration in, identity re-claim and its
    faults, per-task isolation, death retire, stale retire, stale capsule at
    a reused bprm).
- **Birth park and cross-generation qualification** (G019 gaps 1 and 2,
  product-publisher objects only; `full/shared_birth_receipt.h`, host
  contract `testdata/birth_park_contract.c`):
  - Gap 1: the fork source parks its route claim in per-task storage
    (`se_birth_parks`, 80 B) instead of releasing it; the constructor
    target takes exactly that claim (re-checked under the route lock)
    instead of re-admitting the cgroup. The parked early claim holds its
    record (ACTIVE, then RETIRING once a revision commits past it: gap 3)
    and blocks only the withdrawal and reuse of that record, so a revision
    can no longer leave a straddling child unconstructed (CONSTRUCT): the
    target builds from the claim's own record. A failure before construction abandons the park
    (Strict: deny), `lsm/task_free` (`real_owner_capsule_free`) releases a
    park no target took, and a release failure latches the route.
  - Gap 2: a child born under generation g whose first exec is admitted
    under a later generation of the same route (scope, slot, incarnation,
    class) qualifies (`se_birth_receipt_admits`); a receipt newer than its
    route is a QUALIFY fault. The receipt carries the birth class.
  - Witness `opaque_real_birth_park` [0] parked, [1] taken, [2] abandoned,
    [3] stale, [4] put failed, [5] latched, [6] take failed, [7]
    cross-generation qualified. `BirthParkHealth`, `Ready` and `Inspect`:
    a latched park is a sticky Degraded fault; a stale park or a failed
    take is Degraded for 60 s (`FailClosedRateDegradedWindow`).
- **Per-record route holders** (G019 gap 3, product-publisher objects only;
  host contract `testdata/route_holders_contract.c`):
  - The route anchor keeps its holder totals (`early_claims`,
    `source_pins`) and mirrors them per snapshot record
    (`struct se_route_rec rec[2]`: serial, generation, holders, phase; anchor
    112 → 176 B). Every claim, pinned re-claim, release, transfer and pin
    updates the total and its own record.
  - A revision commits while the previous record still has holders: the
    commit requires only the candidate record free of holders; the previous
    record turns RETIRING and keeps its holders, which validate, read and
    release against it. Fresh claims always stamp the ACTIVE record and the
    identity (unpinned) re-claim requires it, so a RETIRING record's holder
    set only shrinks. Readers may release on RETIRING; a claim bound to a
    RETIRING record transfers to a reader of it. The birth constructor
    builds from the RETIRING record of its claim's identity.
  - Drop: `real_owner_snapshot_drop` checks, under the route lock, no early
    claim, source pin or reader on the record before its ticket is released
    (1: holders remain, retryable). The revision drops the old record right
    after its commit (best effort); `opaque_real_route_drop_retired`
    {slot, scope, generation} drops it later (0 dropped, 1 holders remain,
    -1 invariant). No timeout ever clears a holder count.
  - Agent: a revision whose candidate record is still RETIRING with holders
    drops it as soon as they are gone, retrying with a 1 ms → 250 ms
    backoff up to `RevisionDrainTimeout` (`SharedNodeConfig`, default 10 s,
    at most 60 s); on timeout the staged object is discarded, the refusal is
    retryable (`ErrSharedRevisionDraining`) and the binding is Degraded
    `RevisionDrainTimeout` with the record's early claims, pins and readers
    (`Inspect().Revision`, `Ready`; never NotReady), cleared by the next
    committed revision. A stage refused retryably (every spare object held
    by a RETIRING record) past the timeout is Degraded
    `RevisionObjectStarved`. Stale objects drop their RETIRING record first.
  - Residual (accepted, fail-safe): an exec blocked indefinitely between
    passes or inside exec (a fanotify permission event, a FUSE-backed file,
    a ptrace stop) keeps its claim, pin or reader on the RETIRING record,
    so that record and its object stay held. The slot's next revision that
    needs the record waits `RevisionDrainTimeout`, is refused retryably
    (`ErrSharedRevisionDraining`) and the binding is Degraded
    `RevisionDrainTimeout` while the last good revision stays enforced. It
    never allows: the held exec is still judged under the record it holds,
    and no timeout clears a holder. A policy that kills or quarantines such
    a holder is carried to G020.
  - Sizing: policy objects > bindings stays the admission floor (one spare
    for make-before-break). A held RETIRING record keeps its object, so with
    `Bindings + 1` objects one long-held record (a traced or stopped exec)
    starves every other binding's revision until it drains; a node that
    revises bindings independently under such holds can be built with
    `2 × Bindings` objects (`SE_PROFILE_SLOTS_256 = 2 × SE_PROFILE_BINDINGS`
    and the matching `enforce-exec-shared-slots-256` annotation): optional,
    not the default.
  - Open point (to verify on the VM): a reader of the RETIRING record
    evaluates under its own snapshot while the accepted-epoch catalogue may
    already carry the next generation's root epoch (the catalogue invariant
    of `se_exec_reader_authority_locked` assumed a held reader blocks the
    commit).
- **Credit at exit** (G019, `ENFORCE_EXEC_POOL_OPAQUE_EXIT_CREDIT_CANDIDATE`,
  requires the reap events): the exact death settlement runs in
  `tp_btf/sched_process_exit` instead of `lsm/task_free`, so the TASK
  credit no longer waits ~160 ms for the RCU-deferred free. The tombstone
  HASH `se_exit_tombstones` (`SE_PROFILE_EXIT_TOMBSTONES` entries) carries
  the exact identity to `task_free`.
  - Sizing rule: the tombstone table is sized for the **exit burst** (exit
    rate × exit-to-free latency), never by TASK count. Every product profile
    uses 8192 entries whatever its TASK quota: the measured live-tombstone
    peak of the G019 burst (1000 births), steady (400/s) and churn runs is
    824 node-wide (an older build without exit-time birth-receipt retirement
    held about 4.3k), far below the 75 % high mark (6144), and each of two
    bindings owns 4096. The 32 × `SE_PROFILE_TASKS` default when the macro is
    unset exists only so the pre-existing qualification objects stay
    byte-identical. The Go profile carries the same value
    (`SharedProfile.ExitTombstones`, annotation
    `enforce-exec-shared-exit-tombstones`), and qualified admission pins the
    map size to it exactly. A refused tombstone insert (overflow, stale) or
  exit withdrawal takes the slow path: `task_free` settles or resumes as
  before, never earlier. A free-time resume that is refused again leaves the
  withdrawal and the tombstone to the reaper. The witness
  `opaque_real_exit_credit` (`exit_credit.go`) counts every path; any slow
  path or fault is Degraded. `TASK_FREED` wakeups are counted, never reaped.
  - Lifetime: a tombstone an earlier lifetime at the same address left
    behind (failed delete, missed `task_free`) is never trusted. At exit any
    tombstone at the key is an earlier lifetime's (the exit fires once per
    task). At free the tombstone is this lifetime's only if its stored
    `start_time` matches and the directory names no other charge at the key:
    `start_time` alone can repeat, since a non-leader exec (`de_thread`)
    takes the leader's `start_time`, `start_boottime` and pid. A stale one is
    finished as its own free would have (counted `stale`, Degraded) and the
    task at hand takes its normal path. `task_free` consumes a tombstone even
    when the image gate was disarmed after the exit. Link order: attach the
    exit program after `lsm/task_free` and detach it before (the operator
    detaches in exact reverse of `nativeattach.Rank`), so no tombstone is
    created without its consumer. A `FREED` or
    `RESERVED` tombstone whose delete failed at an address never reused
    again is not swept (bounded by the counted `tomb-fault`s; no credit).
  - Reaper: a visit of a DEAD charge whose death lease is still held (an
    exit or free between withdrawal stages, a `DIR_PENDING` exit awaiting
    its free) is PENDING, never a reap fault: `se_or_task_visit` reads
    `active_leases` in the same lock section as its stage snapshot (every
    build, credit at exit or not), and every reaper directory stage needs
    the lease released. A held lease that stays held with no tombstone of
    its own accounting for it (`DIR_PENDING`/`FREE_PENDING`), still found so
    1 s after a visit first found it, counts `held-stuck` once (Degraded), so
    an endless "not yet" cannot hide a lost holder. A directory stage whose
    exact recheck fails (`CORRUPT`) is a fault only if `directory_state` is
    still the snapshot that selected it; a state another visit already
    moved on is PENDING. A reap fault quarantines only that exact charge
    (`ReaperStats.Faulted`, `Degraded()`, `Reaper.Faults`): its slot stays
    charged (fail-closed) until it carries another cookie, and every other
    charge is still reaped; only infrastructure errors (ringbuf, map read,
    reap command run, malformed wakeup) stop the node Reaper. A
    `FREE_PENDING` tombstone is retired only once its lease is released, by
    the reap visit that wins its `FREE_PENDING -> RETIRING` CAS and
    re-checks its exact identity, so concurrent reapers never delete a later
    lifetime's tombstone. A free that cannot rebuild the exit's exact lease
    or release it counts `lease-fault` and leaves it held: the slot stays
    charged (fail-closed, Degraded). Every TASK refund goes through
    `se_or_task_visit` (`se_oc_refund_step` has no other caller; the
    recovery commands `se_rm_*`/`se_command` touch no opaque TASK charge),
    so this pre-step guards every refund path.
  - Accounting: a zombie holds no TASK credit; the quota bounds live tasks,
    the tombstones bound exited-but-unfreed ones. Each binding may hold an
    equal share (`SE_EXIT_TOMBSTONE_ENTRIES / SE_PROFILE_BINDINGS`,
    `opaque_real_exit_accounts`), so one workload keeping its children as
    zombies overflows only its own binding to the slow path (counted
    `account-overflow`, Degraded node-wide: the witness is per node). The
    shares sum to the map size, so the map itself does not fill.
  - Health: `ExitCreditCheck` maps two witness snapshots, the read error and
    the capacity to Healthy, Degraded (a non-benign slow path, a fault, a
    stale tombstone, or the tombstones at 75 % of the map: `live` crossed it
    within the window (`high-crossed`, counted per upward crossing, so a
    repeat peak below the lifetime high-water is seen), the high-water gauge
    rose to it, or `live` is at it now; a peak of an earlier window does not
    degrade later ones) or Unknown
    (unreadable witness, unknown capacity, counter reset: NotReady). A
    `CONTENDED` exit settlement (`unsettled`: the task never owned the
    charge) is a slow path but benign; `LIMIT`/`CORRUPT`/`STALE`
    (`unsettled-fault`) are faults. Wiring it into node health is M6.
  - Birth receipts: `opaque_birth_receipts` is retired at exit too (an exited
    task never execs again and its address cannot be reused before its
    free), so the receipts are bounded by live tasks, not by tasks awaiting
    the RCU-deferred free; under the burst they were the remaining
    bottleneck. Exit retirements are not failed births; `task_free` and
    `free_task` stay the retirement for failed births and for exits before
    the exit link was attached.

Runtime reporting rule for a future `Ready` gate built on the witness
(`FailClosedRateDegradedWindow`, `FailClosedRateNotReadyWindow` and their
thresholds in `fail_closed_rate.go`):

- **Degraded** on any fail-closed refusal (Strict) or unevaluated child
  (Audit) within 60 s.
- **NotReady** when the fail-closed rate is above 0.1% over 5 min.
- An unreadable or missing witness, or a counter that moved backwards, is
  **unknown**, never a zero rate.
- Product-publisher objects (G019 M4) have a 13-cell witness:
  - cell 11 is **ENTRY**: an exec on an OWNED route by a task that has no
    TASK at all, such as a runtime exec entry or a migration into the cgroup.
    It is reported apart, like the WORK retry subset, and is never added to
    Total. A failed open while a TASK exists stays class 8 (open-parent) and
    counts in Total.
  - cell 12 is **ADMISSION**: every exec admission fault of the exec reader
    (a latched, adopting or reserved route, a degraded exec-capsule
    admission, a frozen-class mismatch). Strict and invariant faults deny,
    Audit faults allow, and each is counted as one exec attempt and one
    ADMISSION. It is outside Total, but an ADMISSION rate above the
    threshold degrades the node. (Before this cell such faults were
    uncounted: an Audit route could allow execs unevaluated and invisibly.)
    A fork's admission fault counts ADMISSION too: at the task_alloc source
    (one birth attempt [0] plus ADMISSION), or at the constructor target's
    re-admission (ADMISSION against the birth attempt the source counted;
    a non-fault target re-admission stays CONSTRUCT). One class per attempt.
  - `opaque_real_attempts` counts OWNED birth claims [0] and exec admissions
    [1] (OWNED or ADMISSION faults); their sum is the shared denominator
    (`FailClosedProductRate`).
  - Other objects keep 11 cells (`FailClosedRateCells`).

Root-task adoption (G019 M4, product publisher): a first publication marks
the route as adopting, adopts the cgroup's tasks (`cgroup.threads`, init
leader first), then finishes. Any failure quarantines every adopted entry
and fails the container start with `ErrSharedAdoptionRefused`. Each reason
is counted and reported with the container identity:

- `AdoptionIdentity`: the init identity, its tasks or the cgroup do not
  match.
- `AdoptionTaskRefused`: a present task was refused.
- `AdoptionThreadExited`: an adopted thread exited mid-adoption.
- `AdoptionCloneRefused`: a fork or clone was refused while adopting, for
  example a Go init creating threads.
- `AdoptionFinishRefused`: finish refused the adoption for any other reason.
- `AdoptionAuthentication`: a product command failed authentication.
- `AdoptionDeadline`: the start deadline expired.
- `AdoptionQuarantineIncomplete`: the quarantine still missed entries after
  3 attempts. **Degraded**, with the marked and missed counts. The route then
  stays latched until node teardown and is never withdrawn, in Strict or
  Audit. A latched Audit route claims `AUDIT_FAULT`, which allows the exec
  and counts it.

A quarantine entry whose TASK is already gone has nothing left to mark and
does not make the quarantine incomplete. Only an entry that is found but
cannot be marked does.

The refusal error (`ErrSharedAdoptionRefused`) carries `Audit`. A Strict
refusal must fail the container start. An Audit refusal must not: Audit
never blocks a workload.

Refused adoptions are reported in three places, until the slot is recycled:
`SharedBindingStatus.Adoption`, `NodeEnforcer.AdoptionReport` (the slots and
per-node counters by reason, `AdoptionStuck` included) and `Ready`
(Degraded).

`Remove` never withdraws a slot whose adoption was refused: a withdrawn route
allows every remaining task. It reports withdraw pending, and only the
slot's poller releases it.

A normal `Remove` withdraws the route, then recycles it in the background,
retrying while TASK credits are still held, and frees the slot for reuse.
A refused recycle keeps the slot reserved and is a sticky node fault.

Strict publication is refused unless the agent runs in the initial pid and
time namespaces (design 13.8).

After a complete quarantine, Strict keeps the route latched until the cgroup
is empty. After 30 s it reports `AdoptionStuck` (Degraded); once the cgroup
is empty the route is withdrawn and recycled. Audit withdraws at once. A
withdrawn cgroup is never bound or published again on the node.

Migrate-in residual (known limit): the empty poll and the withdrawal are not
atomic. A task that migrates into the cgroup between them runs under the
WITHDRAWN route, which allows it unevaluated; a withdrawal cannot be undone
from userspace. The poller therefore re-reads the cgroup right after the
withdrawal: a non-empty (or unreadable, not gone) cgroup is reported
`MigratedAfterRelease` (Degraded, counted) in `AdoptionReport` and `Ready`,
kept until node teardown (the slot itself is still recycled and may be
reused). A task that migrates in after that re-read is not detected. Audit
is not checked: it withdraws with its tasks present by design.

Product publication takes a compiled policy (`SharedBindingPolicy.Source`
and `Container`, compiled by `CompileKernelWithRoleEpochs`):

- one policy per binding;
- `init_role` is the compiled root role, never a default, and a policy
  without a root role is refused before any command runs.

The BPF side of the product publisher (`bpf/opaque_real_owner_product_publisher.h`,
`ENFORCE_EXEC_POOL_OPAQUE_PRODUCT_PUBLISHER_CANDIDATE`, product objects and
the `g19pkgpub128` twin only; every other object is byte-identical without
it):

- Commands: `opaque_real_policy_stage`, `opaque_real_route_publish`,
  `_withdraw`, `_recycle`, and `opaque_real_adopt_verify`, `_task`,
  `_finish`, `_quarantine`. Each authenticates (the profile, the caller's
  `se_admin` nonce, the node cookie and a strictly increasing sequence,
  consumed once in `opaque_real_cmd_receipt`) before it changes anything;
  a refusal is code 5 and changes nothing.
- G019 limits: one policy object and one policy UID per snapshot (a
  revision to a different UID is refused, code 2, not retryable); the
  staged object's own policy prefix must carry the request's UID, init
  role and class and a zero root epoch. Multiple policies per binding are
  M8.
- A committed revision drops the previous (RETIRING) record at once, best
  effort, so its policy object unpins and `productCommander` can release it
  (revision deadlock fix: with `Bindings + 1` objects the old object used to
  stay pinned until that slot's next revision, which could never be
  staged). A record with reader claims is never dropped: the drop and the
  `RELEASE` ticket command both refuse it. A refused drop leaves the old
  object stale; stages then refuse retryably until the slot's next
  revision start, withdraw or recycle drops it again.
- Every failed publication undoes its steps in reverse (cgroup locator,
  epoch index, candidate snapshot, route open); the test-only
  `ENFORCE_EXEC_POOL_OPAQUE_PUBLISH_FAULT_DIAGNOSTIC` injects a failure at
  three points for the VM tests.
- A cgroup that was any binding's last published cgroup is refused (code 4).
  `last_cgroup` survives withdraw and recycle; only the slot's next
  successful first publication overwrites it.
- Recycle is idempotent (a FREE route only repeats the cleanup). Code 6
  means the route is FREE but its cleanup could not run: the slot's next
  first publication is refused until a retried recycle cleans it.
- The adopted set (`opaque_real_adopted`) is shared by the bindings and
  capped at the TASK quota per slot; every TASK that may exist after a
  charge attempt is recorded, so quarantine covers it.

## Verification

Ordinary tests exercise concurrency, timeout preservation, publisher ownership,
limits, slot retirement and BPF compilation. Privileged testing is opt-in:

```sh
IG_EXEC_GATE_KERNEL_TEST=1 \
IG_EXEC_GATE_BPF_SOURCE=/absolute/path/bpf/gate_test.bpf.c \
./sandbox-exec-gate-kernel.test -test.run '^TestGateKernel$' -test.v
```

Run only on the explicitly selected disposable x86_64 fixture. The kernel test
loads a socket-filter program and uses `BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN`; it attaches nothing.
It tests actual mmap/BPF atomic interoperability, not LSM facts or full exec roles.

## Historical identities

`IdentityRegistry` reserves compiler-validated policy/role hashes before any
candidate seeding or publication. It retains successful reservations even when
subsequent publication fails. Older task state may still carry those hashes;
policy deletion and reload must never free or rename them. Collision and lifetime
capacity failures leave the registry unchanged. The registry is scoped to one
persistent task-state owner and must not be recreated on every revision. It is
not a substitute for production bootstrap, admission, or publication wiring.

## Prepared program publication

`ProgramSlot` is the native frozen-map publication building block for one future
persistent binding owner. `Begin` drains the shared gate and exposes immutable
staging slot1. Native bootstrap must establish its own proof before `Commit`
atomically replaces active slot0 and permanently records successful UID epochs.
Admission remains closed until native phase cleanup and `Finish`. Precommit
`Abort` preserves the last-good map. Failed staging/epoch cleanup is retained and
blocks new allocation, without restarting the old program. Shared handles cannot
complete another publisher's transaction. Every candidate attempt is monotonic;
removed/re-added UIDs retain their original successful epoch.

The native owner must exclusively control the borrowed maps/gate, enforce
aggregate budgets and retain the binding identity leases. It must clear bootstrap
phase before Finish/Abort, drain before StopGadget, and call CloseAfterDetach only
after actual runtime teardown. This building block neither attaches hooks nor
authorizes lineage or reports a production binding Ready. Its ordinary tests use
failure-injected maps; real map-in-map/freeze proof is separately opt-in.

`epoch_roles.h` is the work-copy merge helper, not a task-storage owner. Its caller
provides complete immutable accepted history and verified lineage, and publishes
only under the task lock after both task and authority versions still match.
Accepted scalar roles are not rerooted, and unactivated failed epochs cannot
become authoritative in another attempt. Kernel socket parity proof is separate
from the native C matrix and from production lifecycle wiring.

## Experimental assembled owner and native publication coordinator

**Legacy ABI2 reference:** this section and the native OCI lifecycle below do not
implement or qualify the shared-node replacement; see the
[shared Go boundary](#legacy-abi2-reference-and-shared-go-boundary).

The shared full source now has an explicit `ENFORCE_EXEC_PERSISTENT_OWNER`
profile. `../full/owner/Makefile` packages it separately; its metadata does **not**
advertise the incompatible immutable full-runtime capability. The profile shares
actual fact acquisition with the immutable evaluator, uses active frozen slot0,
and includes persistent role/control hooks. Compilation/BTF checks are not
verifier acceptance or a production activation claim.

`OwnerControl` borrows loaded maps and the operator's `program/eo_command` handle.
It freezes kernel-owned identity maps before activating the exact configuration,
and runs nonce-qualified commands on one dedicated OS thread. Accepted commands
are joined even when their context is canceled. Closing the worker joins calls
and destroys that physical thread; it never detaches hooks or releases pins.
The rejected negative-PID cgroup.procs write must produce both EINVAL and an
authenticated movement-arm receipt. A path parsing error alone proves nothing.

`Publisher` composes the shared gate, A/B inventory, root-group continuity checks,
immutable slot replacement, successful-only epoch flush, committed revalidation,
and phase clear. First startup must call ProgramSlot.Begin **before** activating
configuration, retain that prepared handle, authorize the exact root, then pass
it to NewPublisher and Resume. It must not briefly reopen an empty active slot.
Precommit refusals attempt bounded rollback; failed rollback retains the closed
handle. A map swap is irreversible even if history flush or a command's result
fails. Resume inspects kernel phase receipts and completes the same generation;
it never reroots accepted state or starts a replacement owner.

PublicationResult.Committed refers to the attempted revision, while Generation
identifies the currently active revision (which can still be last-good on a
refused attempt). Admitting means the gate is open, **not** production Ready.
Runtime leases, hook coverage, image evidence, aggregate budgets, OCI startup and
shutdown integration, and public decoder provenance remain native-owner duties.
Retire must succeed before StopGadget; identity pins remain held until confirmed
teardown. The opt-in assembled-kernel fixture is separate from OCI integration.

The assembled fixture has now passed with real hooks and the qualified worker,
including retained-role capacity refusal/last-good and postcommit recovery. It
also verifies native UAPI write/delete refusal on physical IDs and state. The
kernel does not support Freeze on a TASK_STORAGE value containing a spin lock;
see OWNER-ABI.md for the frozen-cookie + read-only-native-hash layout and its
lifetime/privileged-handle assumptions. Native OCI integration and the embedding's persistent backend are now connected
and have isolated pinned-kernel proof; production/general-environment readiness
is not implied.

## Native OCI lifecycle (isolated pinned-environment proof)

`NewOwner` reserves a **shared** aggregate Budget and exclusive cgroup scope
before the OCI collection can load. All owners in one embedding must share that
budget. Native owner images must contain exactly one eBPF layer and no WASM or other
layers. OCI admission enforces this before initializing any image operators,
including when a supplied native owner encounters missing/rewritten ABI metadata.
Additional collections (including duplicate names) also invalidate native resource
admission.
Resource manifests are checked both at admission and again immediately before
allocation, after parameter, context-variable and enricher rewrites:
map payload capacities,
physical local-storage credits, encoded instruction ceilings and two frozen
program slots are accounted. This is bounded capacity accounting, **not** a
measurement or guarantee of kernel/Go RSS, allocator overhead or JIT expansion.
Reservations remain held until confirmed teardown, including failed startup.

### Attach capacity, readiness and the owner cap (G009)

There is no source-derived owner ceiling. The capacity is the measured
per-trampoline link limit, probed with no-op fillers on both exact AL2023
kernels (`test/al2023-trampoline-cap`):

| hook (trampoline) | kind | 6.12.113-138.209 | 6.18.56-125.164 | preexisting |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| bprm_check_security, task_alloc, task_free, socket_connect, inode_init_security_anon | LSM | 38 | 38 | 0 |
| file_open | LSM | 37 | 37 | 1 (stock VM) |
| bprm_execve, cgroup_migrate, copy_process | fentry, fexit | 38 | 38 | 0 |
| bprm_execve, bprm_check_security | mixed fentry/fexit(/LSM) | 38 | 38 | 0 |

That is **38 links per hook on both kernels** (`BPF_MAX_TRAMP_LINKS`; the
limit hit is `E2BIG` from the link count, not the trampoline image size),
shared by fentry, fexit, fmod_ret and LSM programs on the same trampoline (an
LSM hook `X` uses the trampoline of `bpf_lsm_X`). The 38 is shared with every
other BPF consumer on the node, as the preexisting `file_open` link shows.

* **K/R policy.** Each enforcement family may use at most `K` links per hook
  and must leave `R` free for third parties. `R` defaults to **8**
  (`nativeattach.DefaultReservePerHook`; `operators.NativeAttachReserveKey`
  overrides it), so at most 30 per hook are usable by enforcement families
  together. `K` is the family's own need per hook, derived from its packaged
  attach set, and must be **at most 8** (`nativeattach.MaxFamilyLinksPerHook`).
  The exec candidate needs at most **3** on any hook: bprm_execve 3, and 1
  each on task_free, task_alloc, security_bprm_creds_for_exec and
  bprm_check_security.
* **Packaged attach set.** The candidate's ELF has 13 programs on
  bprm_check_security; 11 are tail-call targets and must never be attached.
  `bpf/opaque_real_owner_child_candidate.programs.yaml` is the gadget.yaml
  `programs:` block that marks every trampoline program outside the steady
  state `attach_to: gadget_program_disabled` (tail-call targets, the two
  bootstrap programs, two diagnostics). The eBPF operator skips those programs
  and leaves them out of `K`. `TestCandidateAttachSetDeclaration` and
  `TestCandidateAttachSetObjects` (with `IG_ENFORCE_EXEC_CANDIDATE_OBJECTS`)
  derive the attach set from that block plus the object and pin it.
  The shared-node qualification path (Phase A, `shared_host.go`) pins the
  steady state at **16 links**: 8 trampoline links
  (`sharedCandidateAttachSet`: 2 on task_free (the product release and the
  exec capsule's death retire), task_alloc, 3 on bprm_execve,
  creds_for_exec, bprm_check_security) and 8 probe links that take no
  trampoline slot (`sharedCandidateProbeSet`: the credit-at-exit
  `tp_btf/sched_process_exit`, the four exec failure-frame kprobes, the
  `free_task` birth kprobe, the `sched_process_fork` raw_tp and the
  `sched_process_exec` tp_btf). It also pins one enabled syscall command,
  `opaque_real_reap` (`sharedCandidateCommandSet`), which is never attached:
  `startLiveCandidate` borrows it and runs the product reaper (`NewReaper`)
  over it with BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN. Every other syscall program stays
  disabled.
* **Product object and diagnostic twins (G019 section 8).** The same
  source builds both. Their enabled set is identical (the 16 links and the
  one command above); they differ in what is compiled in:

  | | Product object | Diagnostic twin (M3, qualified loader) |
  |---|---|---|
  | Build | no `REAL_RECOVERY`, `PRCTL_ARM`, `REAL_LIVE_BOOTSTRAP`; `REAP_EVENTS`, `EXIT_CREDIT`, `-DSE_PRODUCT_NO_TEST_RUN=1` | recovery, live bootstrap (route migration, reload), `REAP_EVENTS`, `EXIT_CREDIT`, `-DSE_PRODUCT_NO_POOL_REAPER=1` |
  | TC (SchedCLS) programs | none | bootstrap, seed, reap, recovery (`se_rm_*`, `se_command`) and TEST_RUN probes: loaded, all disabled |
  | `se_rm_*` programs and maps | not compiled | TC, disabled |
  | Pool reaper (`se_pool_reaper_*`, `se_pool_reap_*`) | not compiled | not compiled |
  | `se_command` | protocol-only `syscall` (`full/shared_control.h`), disabled | TC, disabled |
  | `se_publication_arm` | `fexit/cgroup_kn_lock_live`, disabled | `lsm/task_prctl`, disabled |
  | TEST_RUN probes (`terminal_race_complete`, `work_completion_probe`, `work_retry_probe`) and their gate/selector maps | not compiled (`SE_PRODUCT_NO_TEST_RUN`) | TC, disabled |
  | Terminal-race rendezvous (`opaque_real_terminal_race_witness`, the bounded `bpf_ktime` spin in every WORK completion) | not compiled (`SE_TERMINAL_RACE_RENDEZVOUS` needs `!SE_PRODUCT_NO_TEST_RUN`); only the retain tail-call target stays | compiled |
  | Synchronous WORK return (`ENFORCE_EXEC_POOL_OPAQUE_WORK_SYNC_RETURN_CANDIDATE`: `se_owk_visit_claims`, `opaque_real_work_sync`) | compiled | the burst twins (`g19dec2sync128`, `g19pkgm3sync128`) only; the recovery/OFF identity objects stay without it |
  | Reaper | product reaper: `opaque_real_reap` + `opaque_real_reap_events` (the visit helpers are built for `REAP_EVENTS` without recovery) | the same |
  | Metadata | `candidate/gadget.yaml` + `bpf/…programs.yaml` | + `candidate/gadget.diagnostic.yaml` + `bpf/…programs.diagnostic.yaml` |

  `SE_PRODUCT_NO_TEST_RUN` refuses to compile with recovery, PRCTL_ARM,
  live bootstrap, the abort injector, the deferred storage witness, the
  pending-receipt diagnostic or the fail-closed injectors, and without the
  reap events; reap events without recovery are refused outside the
  product object, and without credit at exit (its `held-stuck` witness is
  the only counter of a death lease left held on a DEAD charge, which the
  reaper otherwise sees as PENDING forever). Reap-event profiles without
  credit at exit (the `off` objects) are recovery builds for qualification
  only, never a product. `TestOpaqueRealVerdictCandidateCompileGuards` pins those
  guards and classifies every TC entrypoint of the source;
  `IG_ENFORCE_EXEC_PRODUCT_OBJECTS` runs `TestCandidateAttachSetObjects`
  and `TestSharedCandidateMergedMetadataObjects` on product objects (no
  SchedCLS program, no `se_rm_*`, no `se_pool_reap*`). The product object
  needs syscall programs that take spin locks (`opaque_real_reap`), so it
  needs kernel ≥ 5.14 (qualified on AL2023 6.12 and 6.18); stock Rocky 4.18
  is not supported by it.
* **Legacy Owner cap.** `NewBudget` refuses more than `LegacyOwnerHardCap`
  (**2**) owners and `NewOwner` refuses a third owner, both with
  `ErrLegacyOwnerCap`, before anything of it is loaded or attached. Each
  owner attaches 10 trampoline links of its own. One Budget must be shared
  per node.
* **No support claim for owner concurrency.** Neither the legacy Owner cap nor
  the 38-link measurement is a supported concurrency figure. Running more
  than one owner per node, or any number of owners next to other BPF
  consumers, is not claimed to be supported; per-owner concurrency is G019.
* **Transactional attach.** Every collection admitted by a native resource
  validator (and only those; ordinary gadgets are unchanged) is attached by
  `pkg/operators/ebpf/nativeattach`: in a fixed order (`nativeattach.Rank`:
  task_free first (the release and the exec capsule's death retire), then the
  `sched_process_exit` tp_btf, task_alloc, movement/cgroup/other hooks, then
  decision hooks: bprm_execve fexit, fentry, creds_for_exec,
  bprm_check_security), all-or-nothing. Stop closes the links in exact
  reverse, so every "attached before" also holds as "detached after": the
  task_free programs detach last, the exit link before task_free (exit credit
  never runs without its task_free consumer), task_alloc before both. Any attach error
  closes this collection's links in reverse order before Start returns, and
  `E2BIG` is a typed `*nativeattach.ErrAttachCapacity{Target, Attached, Err}`
  naming the trampoline. Receipts are published only after every link is
  attached, and a missing receipt fails the transaction.
* **Reserve (hint).** Before attaching, the live links per trampoline are
  counted (`BPF_LINK_GET_NEXT_ID` plus link info). The family refuses with
  `ErrAttachCapacity` unless `K + R` links are free. The hint is not the
  authority; the attach and rollback are.
* **Automatic retry (default).** Every native family retries by default
  (`nativeattach.DefaultRetry`: 500ms doubling to a 30s cap, no attempt
  bound). A capacity refusal does not fail Start: Start blocks, retrying,
  until the family attaches or the gadget context is canceled. While it
  waits the family is NotReady, and each refusal is logged as a typed
  `ErrAttachCapacity` that names the target trampoline. Each attempt re-runs
  the hint and the whole transaction, and a refused attempt leaves no link or
  receipt, so there is never a partial hook set. Errors other than capacity
  (for example a failed link count) are returned at once. A family may
  install its own `nativeattach.Retry` under `operators.NativeAttachRetryKey`
  (`State` then receives every NotReady, Ready and a final non-capacity
  error), or `false` to opt out.
* **Legacy Owner refuses at once.** `WithOwner` sets
  `operators.NativeAttachRetryKey` to `false`: the legacy per-cgroup Owner
  does not retry and its Start returns the capacity refusal immediately.
* **Link-based programs only.** Rollback closes bpf links only. A native
  family is therefore refused, before anything is attached and without
  retry, if an enabled program would attach without a bpf link or with side
  effects rollback cannot undo (kprobes/uprobes, tracepoints, perf events,
  socket filters, TC, sockmap programs, iterators). Admitted are LSM and
  fentry/fexit/tp_btf links, syscall commands and admitted recovery TEST_RUN
  programs, which covers the exec candidate and owner families.
* **Readiness component.** In the native path each receipt's `Check` also
  verifies, by link ID, that the link still exists and references the same
  program. A missing or replaced link returns `*nativeattach.ErrNotReady`
  naming the target; a stale Ready is never reported. This is a component
  check for a future Ready gate: `NodeEnforcer.Ready` stays unavailable.

The native data operator verifies live, operator-owned attachment receipts for
all required hooks, not just image annotations/program FDs. It validates the
trusted transferred lease's proc/cgroup/namespace pins, independently refuses a
root cgroup or the host mount namespace, initializes immutable origins and probes
its own filesystem marker before activating scope. The lease must authenticate
runtime ownership, genuine host identity, stable root/mount constraints and any
complete image-origin evidence. It must not reenter Owner methods.

The exact x86_64 kernel matrix retains the original archived BTF digest
`12f7d6270d8090e944941d3ff77c13339cebe1c394f4ef0d27be1bff0d09561b`.
The additional individually proved artifact has BTF digest
`759807546ae2feaf616dc65c73167439867bb393dc468a4bd39c0ab1bc267d51`:
same Linux source `6b4b543fa18757297ac756a6fe6e64f506b7844a`, with fanotify,
redirect/NAT and CPU bandwidth configuration needed by Kubernetes, plus a
separate local version. Its complete isolated upstream proof and artifact hashes
are recorded in [KERNEL-MATRIX.md](KERNEL-MATRIX.md); private Kubernetes/OTLP
integration remains separate and pending. Both exact gates require
active BPF LSM and enabled ftrace. Unknown digests refuse; neither a matching
release string nor the same source commit establishes support. No general
released-kernel or arm64 support is claimed.

Lifecycle ordering is deliberate:
1. Construct Owner; pass WithOwner and the native data operator to the manager.
2. StartGadget prepares only: scope remains gated and no policy is committed.
3. **After StartGadget succeeds**, explicitly Activate and verify Owner.Check.
4. Update/Resume use the same hooks/maps/task histories, never ReplaceGadget.
5. **Before StopGadget**, successfully drain/retire with BeforeStop. A timeout
   retains old admission/enforcement; do not cancel the runtime in that case.
6. Wait for manager teardown, then ReleaseAfterDetach. Operator Close joins the
   qualified command thread but intentionally does not release identity pins or
   the reservation before eBPF FDs/links are confirmed closed.

Internal owner ABI **2** adds active-only, same-generation physical re-attestation.
ABI1 development artifacts are rejected; the chart version is unchanged.
Movement invalidates the inventory receipt. Owner.Check renews it only behind a
closed/drained gate, with no new roots or epoch writes. Unknown ingress refuses
readiness; after it leaves, accepted state can be re-attested without rerooting.
These pauses can disrupt exec/runtime helpers; there are no inferred exemptions.
The native OCI fixture and ABI2 re-attestation have passed isolated runs with
controlled synthetic leases, real datasource bitmaps and confirmed teardown.
This is not proof of containerd/CRI authenticity, all persistent-profile predicate
combinations, real runtime-helper churn, or the connected node-agent backend.
Those integration prerequisites remain before default activation.

## Reproducible supported owner artifact

The default upstream builder is not proof for this experimental profile. Build an
explicit amd64 archive with the tested compiler and exact supported kernel BTF:

```sh
make -C gadgets/enforce_exec/full/owner archive \
  VMLINUX_BTF=/trusted/vmlinux.btf CLANG=clang-21 BPFTOOL=bpftool \
  IMAGE=localhost/enforce-exec-owner:abi2 ARCHIVE=/tmp/owner.tar
```

This requires Clang 21.1.8 and an exact admitted BTF digest; it never loads BPF.
The archive contains the unchanged owner metadata and a single amd64 platform.
Its compiler/BTF/input bytes are trusted build inputs, not policy-provided code.
Compilation alone is not verifier proof: Clang 19 produced a refused object on
the tested kernel. The embedding's combined fixture accepts the resulting archive
through the same native ORAS tar path as its service configuration.

## Shared-node live health: fail-closed rate witness and accepted G019 residuals

This section supersedes the earlier statements that nothing reads the
fail-closed rate witness at runtime.

**Fail-closed rate witness (G019/G025).** A live qualified node polls
`opaque_real_fail_closed_rates` and `opaque_real_attempts`
(`sharedLiveFailClosed`, `shared_fail_closed_health.go`) every
`SharedNodeConfig.FailClosedPollInterval` (default 5 s, bounded to
[100 ms, 30 s]) into a bounded ring that covers the 5 min window. Each sample
reads the rate cells before the attempts (BPF counts an attempt before its
failure). The runtime reporting rule of `fail_closed_rate.go` is applied
through `FailClosedProductRate`:

| State | Rule | Node health |
|---|---|---|
| Healthy | none of the below | - |
| Degraded (`ErrSharedFailClosedDegraded`) | any fail-closed refusal (Strict), unevaluated child (Audit) or ADMISSION fault within 60 s (threshold 0); clears after a quiet window | `Ready`, `Inspect` (binding `Fault`), qualified operator readiness |
| NotReady (`ErrSharedFailClosedNotReady`) | Total or ADMISSION rate above 0.1% over 5 min (over the node's age while it is younger) | as Degraded |
| Unknown (wraps NotReady) | unreadable witness, a counter moving backwards, or counts `FailClosedProductRate` refuses (ENTRY + ADMISSION + Total above the attempts); sticky until node teardown. A poller with no sample for 3 intervals is Unknown while stalled | as Degraded, and the `StopNode` result |

ENTRY [11] and ADMISSION [12] are outside Total; the denominator of Total is
the attempts minus ENTRY minus ADMISSION, and every rate is per attempt.
ENTRY never degrades. A window's attempts start one sample before its base
sample, so an attempt counted before the base read whose failure lands after
it (a fork's target re-admission) never reads as an inconsistent witness; the
rate is diluted by at most one interval per window. `NodeEnforcer.FailClosedHealth`
reports the state, both window verdicts and the counters since node start.
Only a product object served by its own product publisher is gated (it must
carry the 13-cell witness with `opaque_real_attempts`, or startup is
refused). An object behind a qualification publisher override (the bootstrap
publisher, whose untracked tasks are refused by design) is reported only, and
a legacy 11-cell witness has no denominator: its failures are reported and its
state is Unknown, never a node health input. A refusal rate is never a teardown
failure; only a sticky Unknown is. `NodeEnforcer.Ready` still returns
`ErrSharedNativeUnavailable`.

Class [9] (GAP) counts only the interpreter continuation's refusals (G019
gap 4, H1): `REAL_OWNER_RATE_GAP` is incremented at the one continuation
refusal site (`real_owner_continue_refuse`), with its reason in
`opaque_real_interp_stats`. A later pass refused for a terminal fault before
any continuation counts QUALIFY [6] or PENDING [7], as a first pass does,
never also GAP. Migration relabel (gap 5) is a binding status
(`MigrationOutUnenforced`), never a counted refusal. The G019 gaps 1-3
refusals land in CONSTRUCT [5], QUALIFY [6] and OPEN_PARENT [8], not in
GAP.

**Gap 5, migration relabel (accepted residual, D1/U3).** A TASK-carrying task
moved out of a Strict binding's cgroup into an unrouted cgroup is not
enforced there: admission follows the current cgroup and the migration is not
relabelled. Every published Strict binding reports
`SharedBindingStatus.MigrationOutUnenforced` until the gap is closed. The
label is a status, never a `Fault`. Admission's refusal of privileged and
cgroup-writable pods (U3) narrows who can migrate.

**Gap 6, reload class (accepted).** A route's execution class is frozen at
its first publication, and in-flight execs carry it (the frozen-class
ADMISSION check). A revision that changes the class (Audit to Strict or
back) is refused, terminal, with `ErrSharedClassChange` (wrapping
`ErrSharedNativeUnavailable`). `BindingSession.Publish` refuses it before
any command. The product publisher also names a kernel-refused revise whose
route holds another class. The binding keeps its last-good route. A class
change needs a new binding. Withdrawal is terminal for the cgroup (D5), so
that means a new container bound with the new class.
`TestSharedNodeClassChangeRefusedAttached` (M4 environment:
`IG_SHARED_M4_OBJECT`, `IG_SHARED_M4_CGROUP_ROOT`,
`IG_SHARED_M4_HANDLER_SYMBOL`) asserts the refusal on the isolated VM. It
checks both the Go path and the kernel path. After each refusal it checks
last-good, that no policy object leaks, that the witness is unchanged, and
that a same-class revision commits.
